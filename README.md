# React Pokemon and Playing Cards App
  Welcome to the React Pokemon and Playing Card App, a fun web application that combines two exciting worlds - Pokemon and playing cards! This project showcases a React-based website that interacts with two       
  different APIs, providing users with a delightful experience of catching Pokemon and playing cards.

## Features:
- **Playing Cards:** On the left side of the website, you can click a button to add playing cards to the screen. You can click on each card to flip it, revealing the other side. Additionally, there's a convenient button to clear the table of cards.

- **Pokemon:** On the right side of the website, you can explore the world of Pokemon. Connect to the PokeAPI and catch a Pokemon to view its details, including HP, attack, defense, special attack, and speed stats. Each Pokemon is accompanied by a captivating image. You can use the "I'm feeling lucky" button to generate a random Pokemon or select a specific Pokemon from the drop-down menu. Just like the playing cards, you can flip the Pokemon cards to see the back of each Pokemon.

## Technology Stack:
- React with hooks
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- Axios for API interactions

  This project combines the power of react, html , javascript and API requests to bring the worlds of playing cards and Pokemon together in a seamless web application. Enjoy the app, and feel free to contribute or explore the code!
